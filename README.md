# Time Capsule: Unlocking Memories for the Future – KrackHack 2025 Submission

## ✨ Overview
Imagine a digital time capsule that preserves your most cherished memories—letters, photos, and voice recordings—locked away until a future date of your choosing. Welcome to **Time Capsule**, my innovative submission for KrackHack 2025! This captivating web application lets you create, secure, and share time capsules with friends, family, or the world, blending nostalgia with cutting-edge technology. Dive into a platform where memories become treasures, gamified with points, badges, and a vibrant community feature—perfect for preserving the past and inspiring the future!

## 🌟 Project Description
**Time Capsule** is more than just a memory storage tool—it’s a journey through time. Built with Flask, SQLite, and HTML/CSS, this platform empowers users to:
- **Create Time Capsules**: Craft personal or shared memories with text, photos, or audio, setting unlock dates and expiration options.
- **Secure Your Memories**: Choose visibility (Private, Public, or Friends) and add passwords for added privacy.
- **Engage with the Community**: Explore public capsules, like, comment, and contribute to others’ stories.
- **Earn Rewards**: Unlock badges like “Memory Keeper” or “Optimist” and track streaks through gamification, earning points for every interaction.
- **Manage Your Capsule**: View, edit, or delete capsules, track progress on your dashboard, and manage account settings.
